# MacStadium

Building React Native apps for iOS requires access to a Mac to be able to use XCode and the iOS device
simulators.

We've teamed up with [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/invertase), the leading providers in cloud hosted Mac infrastructure, to provide a discount
offer to all React Native developers.

Try a Mac mini for free for 24 hours and also get 50% off the first two months Mac mini subscription using the code
`INVERTASE50`. For more information, visit the [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/invertase) website.
