# Getting started in 5 minutes

If you're new to React Native or Firebase, we first recommend reading more on those areas before starting with this library.
This guide assumes you have already installed the required development dependencies described on the [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) (React Native CLI Quickstart).

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=quick-start)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=quick-start)

If you're new to React Native development or are starting a fresh project; we recommend starting via our quick-start project template with React Native Firebase pre-integrated and ready for you to jump straight into the code:

- [Starter Kit](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase-starter)

## Start a new React Native project

Firstly create a new React Native project using the [`react-native-cli`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started):
