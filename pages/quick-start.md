# Getting started in 5 minutes

If you're new to React Native or Firebase, we first recommend reading more on those areas before starting with this library.
This guide assumes you have already installed the required development dependencies described on the [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=quick-start)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=quick-start)

If you're already familiar with React Native development, our starter kit has been setup to allow you to jump
