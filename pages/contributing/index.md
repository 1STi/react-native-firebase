## Guidelines

To ensure consistent levels of quality across the library, there are various guidelines which we follow.

### Ownership

This library is licensed under [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and any contributions require a [CLA to be signed](https://www.clahub.com/pages/why_cla) before merging. If you have any questions about code ownership, please get in touch with us on Discord.

### Review process

All contributed code has to be reviewed by two maintainers before being merged. This allows for open discussion between the original author, maintainers and the community.

### Testing

Our testing process is constantly evolving and improving. Any contributions must ensure all tests pass, and any additional functionality added has new tests. You can find out more about the testing process on our [Code & Testing](/contributing/code-testing) contributing page.

## Project Owners

The project is owned and actively maintained by [Invertase](https://invertase.io).
