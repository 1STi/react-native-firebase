# Issues, Pull Requests & Project Management

A lot of time is spent handling GitHub Issues, GitHub Pull Requests and doing general project management and planning.

We appreciate all contributions that help manage us this repository. If you'd like to help, the following areas are a great place to get started.

## Issues Management

- If users have not followed the [issue template](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  reminding them this is required information for us to be able to quickly identify and replicate the problem.
- Linking other related issues, or commenting with a linked duplicate issue.
- Pointing any features requests in the direction of our [Feedback](/feedback) page.

## Pull Requests

- Ensuring any code changes cover both Android & iOS surface areas.
- Updates must not change the API surface area unless discussed on our [Discord](https://invertase.link/discord) server.
- All code additions must be fully tested.
- All code additions must be typed, with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/).
