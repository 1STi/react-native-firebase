# Issues & PRs

We regularly deal with Issues & Pull Requests via our Github repository. We appreciate all contributions to help
manage our repository. If you'd like to help, the following areas are a great place to get started.

## Issues

- If users have not followed the [issue template](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
  reminding them this is required information for us to be able to quickly identify and replicate the problem.
- Linking other related issues, or commenting with a linked duplicate issue.
- Pointing any features requests in the direction of our [Feedback](/feedback) page.

## Pull Requests

- Ensuring any code changes cover both Android & iOS surface areas.
- Updates must not change the API surface area unless discussed on our [Discord](https://invertase.link/discord) server.
- All code additions must be fully tested.
- All code additions must be typed, with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/).
