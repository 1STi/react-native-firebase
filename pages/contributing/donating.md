# Donating

The React Native Firebase library takes a considerable amount of time and effort to maintain. We are 
thankful for every contribution which helps make the library better for everyone. 

We understand that contributing to Open Source can be difficult. If you'd like to contribute but are 
unable to do so, please consider a financial donation (however small), it means a lot to us. 

We use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-firebase) to provide full visibility into how your donation helps us: [https://opencollective.com/react-native-firebase](https://opencollective.com/react-native-firebase).

## Your workplace

If React Native Firebase is used at your workplace, please consider supporting our efforts to ensure
the continued success of the library. We want to ensure all companies using the library have the confidence
in the future updates of our Open Source library.
