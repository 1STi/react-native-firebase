# Add Firebase to your React Native project

## Before you begin

This guide makes the following assumptions

- you have already installed the required development dependencies described on the React Native [getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) documentation.
- you have an active Firebase project

If you do not already have a Firebase project on the Firebase console, visit the following guide first.

<Grid>
	<Block
		title="Creating a Firebase Project"
		to="/quick-start/create-firebase-project"
		icon="forward"
		color="#4CAF50"
	>
		Creating a new Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
  	</Block>
</Grid>

> **Note**: Integration for iOS is currently only supported via CocoaPods see [#2128](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/2128) to learn more or to help implement non-pods support.

## Choose your integration path

You can get started with Firebase in React Native using one of the following options:

<Grid>
	<Block
		title="New Projects"
		to="/quick-start/new-project"
		icon="fiber_new"
		color="#4CAF50"
	>
		Start a new React Native project with Firebase pre-integrated.
  	</Block>
	<Block
		title="Existing Projects"
		to="/quick-start/existing-project"
		icon="forward"
		color="#ffc107"
	>
		Integrate Firebase into an existing React Native project.
  	</Block>
</Grid>
